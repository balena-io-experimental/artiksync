artiksync
=========

Simple demo of resin-sync using a Samsung Artik

Note that this code (intentionally) contains a bug!  This is to demonstrate how `resin sync` can be used to quickly iterate code without need for a full rebuild of a project.

For more information on `resin sync` please consult the [Resin Getting Started Guide](https://docs.resin.io/raspberrypi/nodejs/getting-started/#using-resin-sync-to-develop-fast).
